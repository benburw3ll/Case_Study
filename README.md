Challenges I Faced 
The main challenge I faced was Spring MVC. This was a new concept to me that I had to learn quite fast. After playing around with it, getting help from peers and instructors, and online resources I feel like I made great progress on that learning curve. 
Junit testing on Spring MVC was also a challenge. I found learning the tool Mockito to be quite useful. 

User Stories:
As a user, I want to sign up, so I have an account. 
As a user, I want to log in, so I can access the results page.
As a user, I want to add a result, so that I can update my records.
As a user, I want to edit my results, so that if I make a mistake I can change it. 
As a user, I want to delete my results, so that if I have an old or duplicate entry I can remove it.
